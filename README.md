<h3>Recip.IO</h3>

Recip.IO (also known as Recipio) was created during **HoyaHacks 2024** at Georgetown University by a passionate team from George Mason University: **Arman**, **Annekke**, **Sasha**, and **Bela**.
Recipio was designed with one mission in mind: to help **reduce food waste**. We know how frustrating it can be when you have random ingredients at home, and you're not sure what to do with them. Thatâ€™s where Recipio comes in!

<h3>How It Works</h3>

Just **enter the ingredients** you have on hand or **upload the images of the ingredients**, along with any **allergies** or **dietary restrictions**. Recipio will generate a list of recipes tailored to your needs, making it easy to whip up a delicious meal with what you've got. No more wasted groceries!

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

This repository is for the **front-end** of the application only. The tech stack includes:

- **React**: For building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern development build tool that enhances the development experience for React projects.
