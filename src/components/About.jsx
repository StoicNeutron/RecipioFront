            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Recip.IO (also known as Recipio) was created during HoyaHacks 2024 at Georgetown University by a passionate team from George Mason University: Arman, Annekke, Sasha, and Bela. Recipio was designed with one mission in mind: to help reduce food waste. We know how frustrating it can be when you have random ingredients at home, and you're not sure what to do with them. Thatâ€™s where Recipio comes in!</p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>Just enter the ingredients you have on hand or upload the images of the ingredients, along with any allergies or dietary restrictions. Recipio will generate a list of recipes tailored to your needs, making it easy to whip up a delicious meal with what you've got. No more wasted groceries!</p>
            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>Our project was made possible through the collaboration of a dedicated group of backend and frontend developers, each bringing their unique skills to the table:</p>
